Automated Bash and Python scripts that allow for reduction of ODFs (Orignal Data Files) obtained from the XMM observatory. Developed on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.6. 

## Reducing of XMM data to obtain event lists

In order to use the automated bash scripts to reduce XMM data, it is first required that HEASOFT and SAS are installed. HEASOFT can be downloaded [here](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/install.html), and SAS can be downloaded [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/sas-download). These scripts work with Ubuntu 16.04 and HEASOFT 6.24, cross compatibility has not been tested.

There are three bash scripts (.sh file) that must be run in a specific order in order to obtain event lists
